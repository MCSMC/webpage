Metropolis is a basic algorithm to generate a Markov Chain for Monte Carlo methods.
More details can be found at this link [Metropolis.pdf] (https://github.com/MCSMC/MCMC_sample_codes/raw/master/Metropolis.pdf).
For example, we include and explain some basic sample code for performing a Gaussian integral in [C](https://github.com/MCSMC/MCMC_sample_codes/blob/master/Gaussian.c)
or [Fortran90](https://github.com/MCSMC/MCMC_sample_codes/blob/master/Gaussian_Metropolis.f90)
